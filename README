webutils was created with the intent to stick to the unix philosophy's aspects of keeping things simple and modular
while making it fast and keeping the memory consumption low.
webutils input and output uses length-prefixed strings instead of null terminated input or lines.
this choise was made to avoid allocating memory beyond the amout necessary and simplicity.

if your server is having a bottleneck, if you're obcessed with optimization or if you are just curious,
you can make webutils commands built-in your program or shell. By doing this, each call to a command will
run on the same process instead of creating a new one. You can even make it built-in busybox on an embedded system.
