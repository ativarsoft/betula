    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>What is betula?</h2>
    <p>
      Betula is a general purpose programming language.
    </p>
    <h2>Is Betula compiled or is it interpreted?</h2>
    <p>
      Both. Betula code can be run using the compiler in
      interpreter mode or compiled by running the
      compiler in compiled mode.
    </p>
    <h2>
      XML is not a programming language, so how Betula
      can be a programming language?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Betula is not XML, but it is built on top of XML.
      Betula is an extension of XML that adds plug-in
      support, control flow (if, swhile, ewhile) and
      place holders for text (known as filled text
      internally).
    </p>
    <h2>What can I use Betula for?</h2>
    <p>
      Betula is mostly used as a backend language for
      web services.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do I use Betula as a programming language on
      the Apache web server?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Place a text file containing Betula source code on
      Apache html directory. Apache will consider files
      ending with the <code>.tmpl</code> filename
      extension to be Betula programs. Apache will
      execute them. If your web server displays the
      content of the Betula file, instead of executing
      it, it means that your web server has a
      configuration error and is not set up properly.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I run Betula as a command line program?</h2>
    <p>
      Execute the betula compiler using the
      <code>betula</code> command with the
      <code>PATH_TRANSLATED</code> environment variable.
    </p>
