    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h2>What is pollen?</h2>
    <p>
      Pollen is a general purpose programming language.
    </p>
    <h2>Is Pollen compiled or is it interpreted?</h2>
    <p>
      Both. Pollen code can be run using the compiler in
      interpreter mode or compiled by running the
      compiler in compiled mode.
    </p>
    <h2>
      XML is not a programming language, so how Pollen
      can be a programming language?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pollen is not XML, but it is built on top of XML.
      Pollen is an extension of XML that adds plug-in
      support, control flow (if, swhile, ewhile) and
      place holders for text (known as filled text
      internally).
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is the difference between Pollen and
      Rackets's Pollen?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rackets's pollen is not a general purpose
      programming language, but a preprocessor macro
      language. An example of a preprocessor language is
      M4. Examples of programming languages are C and
      Java.
    </p>
    <h2>What can I use Pollen for?</h2>
    <p>
      Pollen is mostly used as a backend language for
      web services.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do I use Pollen as a programming language on
      the Apache web server?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Place a text file containing Pollen source code on
      Apache html directory. Apache will consider files
      ending with the <code>.tmpl</code> filename
      extension to be Pollen programs. Apache will
      execute them. If your web server displays the
      content of the Pollen file, instead of executing
      it, it means that your web server has a
      configuration error and is not set up properly.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I run Pollen as a command line program?</h2>
    <p>
      Execute the pollen compiler using the
      <code>pollen</code> command with the
      <code>PATH_TRANSLATED</code> environment variable.
    </p>
